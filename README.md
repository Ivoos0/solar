# Price-aware battery planner for Home Assistant (Flanders)

A Home Assistant [pyscript](https://github.com/custom-components/pyscript) project. Every five
minutes it decides what a home battery should do (charge, discharge, export or idle), using dynamic
electricity prices (ENTSO-e), a solar forecast (forecast.solar), your expected household usage and
the Flemish capacity tariff (capaciteitstarief), which bills your monthly quarter-hour peaks.

## What it does today

- It decides and writes the decision to a log file, one line per cycle. It also publishes its state
  as a few Home Assistant sensors you can put on a dashboard (see [Sensors](docs/alerts-and-sensors.md#sensors)). There is no
  dashboard of its own.
- It does not control your inverter. The default driver, `logging`, sends nothing. To act on the
  decisions you add a driver for your inverter (see [Adding an inverter driver](docs/inverter-drivers.md#adding-an-inverter-driver)).
  None is shipped. When one is enabled, the driver is sent a command only when it changes, and again
  after about 80 % of the time the driver says the inverter keeps a command (or, when it does not say,
  after `inverter.resend_minutes`, default 15), not on every five-minute cycle. `idle` is sent once
  after a forced mode and not repeated while idle lasts. The log line is still written every cycle.
- With the `logging` driver the battery charge is a fixed 50 %. Every record carries
  `degraded=soc_stubbed`. A driver that reads the real charge removes the marker. The charge is real
  as soon as you set `battery.soc_sensor` to a sensor that holds it in percent (for example the AlphaESS
  sensor in [AlphaESS inverter, read-only](docs/alphaess.md#alphaess-inverter-read-only-home-assistant-modbus)):
  the planner and the peak guard then read that sensor and nothing is stubbed. If the sensor cannot
  be read, the planner does not guess: it holds (no charging from the grid, no exporting) and marks
  the record `soc_unavailable`. Peak shaving still works.
- It can read an AlphaESS inverter through Home Assistant's modbus integration, read-only: the real
  battery charge, the battery power and the energy counters (see
  [AlphaESS inverter, read-only](docs/alphaess.md#alphaess-inverter-read-only-home-assistant-modbus)). Nothing is
  written to the inverter, so its default behaviour is unchanged.
- Household usage history comes from energy counters you configure (see [Energy history](docs/history-and-reports.md#energy-history)).
  Until a `load` counter (or `solar` plus both battery counters) is configured, records carry
  `usage_history_unavailable` and the planner holds: it does nothing price-driven (no charging from
  the grid, no exporting) and logs idle with the reason "no usage history:
  planner holds". Only peak protection still acts, because it reads the live grid reading and does
  not need history. While the planner holds, the inverter's own behaviour applies.

If you install it, your battery behaves exactly as before. What you get is a log of decisions you can
compare with what the battery actually did.

## Does it fit your setup

| You need | Notes |
|---|---|
| Belgian digital meter with a P1 port | The capacity-tariff features read the meter's own demand registers |
| SlimmeLezer P1 reader | Stock firmware does not publish the demand registers. You must reflash it (see [step 3](docs/install.md#install)) |
| Home Assistant with HACS and pyscript | Container installs work, no add-ons needed |
| ENTSO-e API key | Free. Used by the Home Assistant ENTSO-e integration for dynamic prices |
| Solar array | One roof plane. The forecast logic assumes it |
| Home battery with a hybrid inverter | The planner decides what the battery should do; acting on it needs a driver |
| A working SMTP account | For the alert e-mails. Optional, but the price-outage alert needs it |

The capacity-tariff logic is specific to the Flemish tariff: billing on the average of the monthly
quarter-hour peaks, with a 2.5 kW floor, on grid offtake only. Elsewhere the price logic may still be
useful; set `capacity_tariff.enabled: false`.

The planner reads the meter's netted total offtake (`sensor.slimmelezer_power_consumed`) and never sums
per-phase sensors, because on a three-phase connection one phase can export while another imports. If
your reader only offers per-phase sensors, the capacity features will read the wrong value.

Not supported: control of anything but the battery (EV charger, heat pump, boiler), several solar
planes, paid forecast tiers, solar curtailment.
